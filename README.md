This project is a web application developed for Medanta Clinic to facilitate the online booking of appointments and patient admissions. It is built using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF). The application allows patients to book appointments remotely and manage their visits to the clinic efficiently.Patients can book appointments by providing their full name, birth year, phone number, preferred appointment date and time, and the source of referral.The application supports dynamic scheduling of appointments, allowing for flexible start and end times that can be adjusted through the admin panel.Appointment times are presented in 10-minute intervals, with customizable start and end times.Patients can select how they heard about the clinic from a predefined list of options (Instagram, Telegram, doctor recommendation, regular customer, friend recommendation).The system supports an in-person queue for patients visiting the clinic, where they can press a button to get a queue number.The list of pre-booked and in-person appointments is displayed on a monitor in the clinic, ensuring efficient patient management.
